Mother web site and REST service

Mother is a web site and REST API that I use to get continuous status updates from the many deployed programs, devices, and systems that I have in the field. Every hour each location sends a current status update to Mother. Remote sites can also send a variety of status reports when needed. The web site can then be used to view and organize the incoming streams of data into reports. This way I can see the health of all of the remote sites at a glance and review the status history in detail if needed.
